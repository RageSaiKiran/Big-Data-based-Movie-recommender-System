# Big-Data-based-Movie-recommender-System
 This project is about movie analysis based on user ratings by concept of correlation. The content based filtering algorithm is implemented in the system. In today’s digital world where there is an endless variety of content to be consumed like books, videos, articles, movies, etc., finding the content of one’s liking has become a complicated task. On the other hand, digital content providers want to engage as many users on their service as possible for the maximum time. This is where analysis system comes into picture where the content providers recommend users the content according to the users’ liking. The objective of Movie Vender is to provide accurate movie analysis to users. Usually the basic analysis systems consider one of the following factors for generating analysis; the preference of user (i.e. content based filtering).
